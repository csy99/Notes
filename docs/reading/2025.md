# Klara and the Sun

Kazuo Ishiguro

虽然我读的是英文版，但还是决定用中文来写这篇笔记。

Klara是第二代机器人，即便在机器人中也拥有很出众的观察能力，和对人类世界的理解。后来Josie和她妈妈将她从商店买走。因为Josie经历了基因编辑，身体非常虚弱。她妈妈的本意是Josie去世后，Klara模仿而代替Josie。因为不断经历各种事情，Klara的情感也逐渐开发。让我很惊讶的是，这本书最后是个大圆满结局，Josie身体恢复了健康。作者文笔很好，书中情节紧凑，有真实感。从故事中的引导出来的话题多样且开放，有基因编辑、教育、生活方式与环境、机器人伦理、爱、信仰等。

# The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor

Howard Marks

## Second Level Thinking

Psychology plays a major role, and its variablility leads to unreliable cause-and-effect relationships. One's investment approach should be intuitive and adaptive.

Second level thinking is about considering the probability of future outcomes, people's consensus, and price related.

## Understanding Market Efficiency and Limitations

Efficient market theory suggests there is no alpha (investing skill). The difference in return results from difference in risk.

To achieve superior results, we have to have an edge in either information or analysis, or both. 

## Value

The author does not believe in technical analysis. He thinks momentum investing may be helpful in a bull market but it has a lot of drawbacks. Instead, he believes in value investing and growth investing, in particular the former. Because the upside potential for being right about value is more consistent.

A firmly held view on value can help us cope with the case where the market does not validate what we think.

## The Relatioship Between Price and Value

The price is mostly affected by psychology and technicals.

People should like something less when its price rises, but in investing they often like it more.

The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

## Understanding Risk

In order to attract capital, riskier investments have to offer the prospect of higher returns, or higher promised returns, or higher expected returns. But there's absolutely nothing to say those higher prospective reutrns have to materialize. 

Risk is volatility or variabiulity or deviation. Not "peril".

## Recognizing Risk

Risk tolerance is antithetical to successful investing. When people aren't afraid of risk, they will accept risk without being compensated for doing so, and risk compensation will disappear. 

When everyone believes something is risky, their unwillingness to buy usually redecues its price to the point where it's not risky at all. Broadly negative opinion can make it the least risky thing, since all optimism has been driven out of its price.

Most investors think quality, as opposed to price, is the determinant of whether something is risky. But it is just a mtter of the price paid for them. 

## Controlling Risk

Loss observable but risk is invisible. Loss is what happens when risk meets adversity.

The best test for bearing risk is a record of repeated success over a long period of time.

Unusual, unlikely things can happen. Once in a while, a black swan will materialize. 

## Being Attentive to Cycles

Most things will prove to be cyclical. Success carries within itself the seeds of failure, and vice versa. 

Cycles are self-correcting. The credit cycle will drive the fluctuations of the economic cycle. 

## Awareness of the Pendulum

Finance theory is heavily dependent on the assumption that investors are risk averse. But there are times when people get too comfortable with risk and thus when prices incorporate a premium for bearing risk that is inadequate to compensate for the risk present. 

In an ideal world, investors would balance the risk of losing money and the risk of missing opportunity. The pendulum is moving between the polarities of fear and greed. The swing of investor psychology toward an extreme causes energy to build up that eventually will contribute to the swing back in the other direction.

## Combating Negative Influences

Inefficiencies -- mispricings, misperceptions, mistakes that other people make -- provide potential opportunities for superior performance. Exploting them is the only road to consistent outperformance. 

To avoid losing money in bubbles, the key is refusing to join in when green and human error cause positives to be wildly overrated and negatives to be ignored. Bubbles are capable of arising on their own and need not be preceded by crashes, whereas crashes are invariably preceded by bubbles. 

## Contrarianism

Contrarianism is not an approach that will make you money all of the time. Much of the time there are not great market excesses to bet against. 

Overpriced is incredibly different from going down tomorrow. Markets can be over or underpriced and stay that way for years. 

You must do things not just because they are the opposite of what the crowd is doing, but because you know why the crowd is wrong. 

If everyone likes it, it's likely the price has risen to reflect a level of adulation from which relatively little further appreciation is likely.

Skepticism is saying "that is too good to be true" at the right times. (or maybe too bad)

## Finding Bargains

The process of investing has to be rigorous and disciplined. And it is by necessity comparative.

Search for good buys not good assets. We have to understand what causes an asset to be out of favor. 

1. objective defect

2. irrationality or incomplete understanding

3. its price has been falling

## Patient Opportunism

Waiting for bargains is often your best strategy. Missing a profitable opportunity is of less significance than investing in a loser. 

## Knowing What You Don't Know

Most of the time, people predict future based on recent past. It may be right much of the time, but does not provide value, because the market thinks so too. When the future turns out to be different, an accurate forecast is of great value. But people are unlikely to be right consistently, so forecasts are not valuable.

One key question investors have to answer is whether they view the future as knowable or unknowable. If you dont know, then diversification and levering less is important. 

## Having a Sense for Where We Stand

We need to understand the past and the present.

Are investors optimistic? Do the media say the markets should be piled into? Are novel investment readily accepted? ...

## Appreciating the Role of Luck

Stock depends on randomness. We should recognize that. Sometimes, the earning does not result from skill.

Investors can be right or wrong all the time for the wrong reason.

We may have an idea which one outcome is most likely to occur, but we also know there are many other possibilities, and thos other outcomes may have a collective likelihood much higher than the one we consider most likely.

## Investing Defensively

"Unforced errors". In amateur tennis game, the point is not won, it is lost.

Even highly skilled investors can be guilty of mis-hits. Thus, defense is an important part of every great investor's game.

Few people have the ability to switch tactics from offense to defense to match market conditions on a timely basis. 

## Avoiding Pitfalls

The assumption that something can't happen has the potential to make it happen, since people who believe it can't happen will engage in risky behavior and thus alter the environment.

It is important to avoid pitfalls, but there must be a limit.

We have to understand the knock-on consequences of extreme events.

When there is too much capital chasing too few ideas, investments will be made that do not deserve to be made. When capital goes where it should not, bad things happen.

Widespread disregard for risk creates great risk.

Inadequeate due diligence leads to investment losses. 

In heady times, capital is devoted to innovative investments, many of which fail the test of time.

## Adding Value

beta: a measure of a portfolio's relative sensitivity to market movements

alpha: personal investment skill

y = alpha + beta*x, y is portfolio performance, and x is the return of the market

It's not just your return that matters, but also what risk you took to get it. Beating the market does not mean superior investing. When comparing the record of a defensive investor and an agressive one, we need to do style adjusting.
