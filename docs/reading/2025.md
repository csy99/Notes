# Klara and the Sun

Kazuo Ishiguro

虽然我读的是英文版，但还是决定用中文来写这篇笔记。

Klara是第二代机器人，即便在机器人中也拥有很出众的观察能力，和对人类世界的理解。后来Josie和她妈妈将她从商店买走。因为Josie经历了基因编辑，身体非常虚弱。她妈妈的本意是Josie去世后，Klara模仿而代替Josie。因为不断经历各种事情，Klara的情感也逐渐开发。让我很惊讶的是，这本书最后是个大圆满结局，Josie身体恢复了健康。作者文笔很好，书中情节紧凑，有真实感。从故事中的引导出来的话题多样且开放，有基因编辑、教育、生活方式与环境、机器人伦理、爱、信仰等。

# The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor

Howard Marks

## Second Level Thinking

Psychology plays a major role, and its variablility leads to unreliable cause-and-effect relationships. One's investment approach should be intuitive and adaptive.

Second level thinking is about considering the probability of future outcomes, people's consensus, and price related.

## Understanding Market Efficiency and Limitations

Efficient market theory suggests there is no alpha (investing skill). The difference in return results from difference in risk.

To achieve superior results, we have to have an edge in either information or analysis, or both. 

## Value

The author does not believe in technical analysis. He thinks momentum investing may be helpful in a bull market but it has a lot of drawbacks. Instead, he believes in value investing and growth investing, in particular the former. Because the upside potential for being right about value is more consistent.

A firmly held view on value can help us cope with the case where the market does not validate what we think.

## The Relatioship Between Price and Value

The price is mostly affected by psychology and technicals.

People should like something less when its price rises, but in investing they often like it more.

The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

## Understanding Risk

In order to attract capital, riskier investments have to offer the prospect of higher returns, or higher promised returns, or higher expected returns. But there's absolutely nothing to say those higher prospective reutrns have to materialize. 

Risk is volatility or variabiulity or deviation. Not "peril".

## Recognizing Risk

Risk tolerance is antithetical to successful investing. When people aren't afraid of risk, they will accept risk without being compensated for doing so, and risk compensation will disappear. 

When everyone believes something is risky, their unwillingness to buy usually redecues its price to the point where it's not risky at all. Broadly negative opinion can make it the least risky thing, since all optimism has been driven out of its price.

Most investors think quality, as opposed to price, is the determinant of whether something is risky. But it is just a mtter of the price paid for them. 

## Controlling Risk

Loss observable but risk is invisible. Loss is what happens when risk meets adversity.

The best test for bearing risk is a record of repeated success over a long period of time.

Unusual, unlikely things can happen. Once in a while, a black swan will materialize. 

## Being Attentive to Cycles

Most things will prove to be cyclical. Success carries within itself the seeds of failure, and vice versa. 

Cycles are self-correcting. The credit cycle will drive the fluctuations of the economic cycle. 

## Awareness of the Pendulum

Finance theory is heavily dependent on the assumption that investors are risk averse. But there are times when people get too comfortable with risk and thus when prices incorporate a premium for bearing risk that is inadequate to compensate for the risk present. 

In an ideal world, investors would balance the risk of losing money and the risk of missing opportunity. The pendulum is moving between the polarities of fear and greed. The swing of investor psychology toward an extreme causes energy to build up that eventually will contribute to the swing back in the other direction.

## Combating Negative Influences

Inefficiencies -- mispricings, misperceptions, mistakes that other people make -- provide potential opportunities for superior performance. Exploting them is the only road to consistent outperformance. 

To avoid losing money in bubbles, the key is refusing to join in when green and human error cause positives to be wildly overrated and negatives to be ignored. Bubbles are capable of arising on their own and need not be preceded by crashes, whereas crashes are invariably preceded by bubbles. 

## Contrarianism

Contrarianism is not an approach that will make you money all of the time. Much of the time there are not great market excesses to bet against. 

Overpriced is incredibly different from going down tomorrow. Markets can be over or underpriced and stay that way for years. 

You must do things not just because they are the opposite of what the crowd is doing, but because you know why the crowd is wrong. 

If everyone likes it, it's likely the price has risen to reflect a level of adulation from which relatively little further appreciation is likely.

Skepticism is saying "that is too good to be true" at the right times. (or maybe too bad)

## Finding Bargains

The process of investing has to be rigorous and disciplined. And it is by necessity comparative.

Search for good buys not good assets. We have to understand what causes an asset to be out of favor. 

1. objective defect

2. irrationality or incomplete understanding

3. its price has been falling

## Patient Opportunism

Waiting for bargains is often your best strategy. Missing a profitable opportunity is of less significance than investing in a loser. 

## Knowing What You Don't Know

Most of the time, people predict future based on recent past. It may be right much of the time, but does not provide value, because the market thinks so too. When the future turns out to be different, an accurate forecast is of great value. But people are unlikely to be right consistently, so forecasts are not valuable.

One key question investors have to answer is whether they view the future as knowable or unknowable. If you dont know, then diversification and levering less is important. 

## Having a Sense for Where We Stand

We need to understand the past and the present.

Are investors optimistic? Do the media say the markets should be piled into? Are novel investment readily accepted? ...

## Appreciating the Role of Luck

Stock depends on randomness. We should recognize that. Sometimes, the earning does not result from skill.

Investors can be right or wrong all the time for the wrong reason.

We may have an idea which one outcome is most likely to occur, but we also know there are many other possibilities, and thos other outcomes may have a collective likelihood much higher than the one we consider most likely.

## Investing Defensively

"Unforced errors". In amateur tennis game, the point is not won, it is lost.

Even highly skilled investors can be guilty of mis-hits. Thus, defense is an important part of every great investor's game.

Few people have the ability to switch tactics from offense to defense to match market conditions on a timely basis. 

## Avoiding Pitfalls

The assumption that something can't happen has the potential to make it happen, since people who believe it can't happen will engage in risky behavior and thus alter the environment.

It is important to avoid pitfalls, but there must be a limit.

We have to understand the knock-on consequences of extreme events.

When there is too much capital chasing too few ideas, investments will be made that do not deserve to be made. When capital goes where it should not, bad things happen.

Widespread disregard for risk creates great risk.

Inadequeate due diligence leads to investment losses. 

In heady times, capital is devoted to innovative investments, many of which fail the test of time.

## Adding Value

beta: a measure of a portfolio's relative sensitivity to market movements

alpha: personal investment skill

y = alpha + beta*x, y is portfolio performance, and x is the return of the market

It's not just your return that matters, but also what risk you took to get it. Beating the market does not mean superior investing. When comparing the record of a defensive investor and an agressive one, we need to do style adjusting.

# Chip War

Chris Miller

## Cold War Chips

Wars demand high end tech, and semiconductor becomes one of the most important. Many scientists contributed to the theories and its applications.

## The Circuitry of the American World

Soviet tried to replicate the chips America produced. However, even though they understood the theory, they did not know how to manufacture. Moreoover, the cutting edge was constantly changing.

Japen understood the importance of this technology partially thanks to the American occupation. US wanted to help rebuild Japan's economy to prevent the expansionf of communism. Plants were built in Japan to produce chips.

Sporck laid the grounds for the Asia centric supply chains.

Vietname war has been a successful testing ground for weapons that carried microelectronics.

Intel were founded and they launched DRAM.

## Leadership Lost

The chip developed fast in Japan, and this brought competition. This is due to the combination of intellectual property theft, government subsidies and the hard working of the workers. American government decided and began to save the semiconductor industry.

## America Resurgent

Rather than getting out of the industry where Japense are, Micron decided to compete directly by cutting costs aggressively. They chose to shrink the size of the chip so that they could produce more each time, along with simplifiy the manufacture process. 

On the other hand, Intel laid off people and replicated new manufacturing method that were proved working. This is a huge culture shift.

In the meantime, Samsung decided to enter the semiconductor industry. It received assistance from the US, including both market and technology.

The Soviet Union adopted the copy strategy and thus could never catch up. The military force degraded dramatically. The management was stale and meddling. Another problem was overreliance on military customers. 

Japan was beat by the financial crisis. The enterprises missed the opportunity of PCs.

## Integrated Circuits, Integrated World

At the time, most companies manufactured chips they designed in-house. Morris Chang had an idea for a new business model, which is manufacture only, and it was backed up by the Taiwanese government. TSMC was built.

China's chip industry was far behind because of the Cultural Revolution. Later, the Four Modernizations policy tried to revive the industry. To gain expertise, joint ventures between China and foreign countries were founded. Richard Chang, a Taiwanese with complex identities, founded SMIC. A lot of foreign trained workforce were hired and it helped the development of the industry.

Some technology advances come from reasearch that costs a lot and are questionable if it can lead to a success. For example, the EUV lithography at ASML. 

Insights are important. Intel turned down Apple's request on iphone chips, and thus Arm was benefitted. 

## Offshoring Innovation

A lot of DRAM and NAND facotries were located in Asia. This left a hidden danger in the future for the US. However, at the time, fabless was the trend, especially when the first generation of CEOs stepped down.

Morris Chang realized the importance of mobile chips. And TSMC had an advantage over Samsung not owning any in house designed chips.

TSMC, Intel, and Samsung decided to invest more in EUV lithography to develop more advanced process, and that means smaller transistors. 

AI workloads require running the same calculation repeatedly, using different data. A customized chip for AI is crucial in the economic aspect. Nvidia designed graphic chips, and GPUs could help train AI efficiently. Google also began to develop TPUs. On the contrary, Intel's near-monopoly is ending. The foundry was not supported internally, and had a hard time integrated with external clients.

## China's Challenge

China spend more money importing semiconductors than oil and it became a hidden danger. Only by owning core technologies such as developing chips can China avoid the fate of continuing the low profit industries.

Trump started a trade war, which was followed by the chip ban. China reacted with policies and subsidies to encourage the development of semiconductors. However, a complete disintegration from the Silicon Valley is difficult. China wants something more than a higher market share, because security dominates efficiency. 

Some companies helped shape the Chinese semiconductor industry. IBM changed its strategy for dealing with China from selling chips to opening its chip technology to Chinese partners, partially due to its disadvantages competing with Intel. Wualcomm also wanted to break into the data center chip business using an Arm architecture, which is different from Intel's. AMD sold a large share of its semiconductor assembly, testing, and packaging facilities, along with the license to produce a modified x86 chips. Half of the Arm China was sold to Chinese investors. Every chip firm has subsectors that they don't lead, that they'd be happy to share for a price. That is the opportunity for China. 

There are certain important domestic players. Tsinghua Unigroup bought some fabless companies and participated in the chip game. Huawei embraced foreign competition from its earliest days, which is different from most of its counterparts. It spent several times more on R&D than other Chinese tech firms. More importantly, it had a leading advantage in 5G.

The military force will be changed by the computing powers. The battle for the electromagnetic spectrum will be an invisible struggle conducted by semiconductors.

## The Chip Choke

The US government presumed China would use its position as the world's key manufacturer of electronics to insert back doors and to spy more effectively, just as the US had done for decades. Therefore, the government sticked to the "run fast" plan. The semiconductor industry in the US enjoyed the benefits of low tax and reduced regulation, at the cost of abandoning part of Chinese markets, which is a huge change to their multinational business model.

The DRAM market was dominated by Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix. Jinhua in Fujian, China wanted to acquire know-how by partnering with Taiwan. Despite the lack of the technology, there were some DRAM facilities in Taiwan. Some tech stealing happened and cases were filed. Micron was ousted from the Chinese market. If Jinahua gained the capbility of mass production in the next few years, then Micron returning back to the market would be impossible.

Although the whole chip pipeline is distributed all over the world, some key choke points remained. For instance, the design software companies are in the US, the fabrication is in Samsung and TSMC, and the EUV production is in ASML.

Technological independence is a dream even for the US. China lacks cutting-edge design software, advanced materials, and fabricatoin know-how. Moreover, the production cost will be higher because of the tech lagging. 

# 维特根斯坦传 天才之为责任

瑞 蒙克

## 自我毁灭的试验场

维特根斯坦最开始的哲学问题是思考诚实的意义。他小时候顺从，有时候会为了讨好说出违背自己意愿的话。长大后性格有很大改变，对于真的追求很坚持。这与他的家境有关。他家境很富裕，父亲很有投资眼光。但对于孩子的教育，父亲早期态度强硬，逼死了两个想学艺术的哥哥。他小时候反倒不如其他兄弟姐妹有天赋，可能这也是顺从性格的来源。在上学期间，受到魏宁格的影响很重。

## 曼彻斯特

维特根斯坦攻读航空专业，还对数学产生了兴趣，拜读了罗素的著作。他甚至尝试解决了罗素发现的关于类的难题。后来逐渐对哲学产生兴趣。

## 罗素的爱徒

维特根斯坦去请教罗素，罗素一方面肯定他的智商，另一方面可以说是被缠得有些烦。他最后得到了罗素的肯定，放弃了航空的学业。

## 罗素的导师

维特根斯坦很痛苦，他觉得他如果不在欣赏或者创造伟大作品，就是浪费生命。罗素认为W是精确的，但狭隘，对不确定的意见和不充分的观点太缺乏耐心。W和品生特的友谊愈发牢固，跟他在一起能暂时忘掉逻辑的研究，享受生活。罗素则太容易在W身上看到自己放大的缺点。

W总认为自己快死了，怕自己不能发表工作成果，但是他又是个完美主义者，不解决掉所有障碍不愿意动笔。好在罗素答应帮他出版，即便他已不在人世。W详细地阐述了自己的构思，才有了《逻辑学笔记》。

## 挪威

维特根斯坦去挪威是想远离世俗，更好地研究逻辑。他跟其他人都不投缘，除了极个别几个人。

W有如下哲学观念：1）哲学没有推导，是纯粹描述性的；2）哲学不给出现实的图像；3）哲学不和科学研究一致，也不反驳科学研究；4）哲学有逻辑和形而上学组成，逻辑是基础；5）认识论是心理学的哲学；6）不信任语法，是做哲学的第一个必备条件。

## 火线之后

一战中维特根斯坦作为志愿兵加入奥地利，一来是认为爱国情怀，二来是想从事一点非脑力劳动。与底层士兵的相处令W痛苦。而《圣经》拯救了他。后来担任军队办公室职员期间，还读了尼采的作品，跟基督精神完全相背离。他部分认同尼采的观点。在他看来，问题不在于基督教是否为真，而在于基督教是否提供了一点帮助。

## 在前线

维特根斯坦主动要求去到最前线。而且他更习惯独自面对孤独危险的岗位，他觉得同事很多醉鬼，性格也不好。

在战争的后半段，W对意志和自我的论述符合叔本华的先验观念论。W仅仅多加了限制，唯我论者不能被说出，只能显露自身。W逐渐从对逻辑基础的思考转向世界的本质。

被俘后，W又恢复了和罗素的通信。罗素是为数不多能够稍微理解W且愿意给予肯定的人。

## 印不出的真理

战争结束后，维特根斯坦把所有继承的家产都给了兄弟姐妹。由于各种原因，罗素等老朋友也没办法及时去看望他。自己写的书也没人能理解，更遑论被出版。W的心情非常糟糕。

最终W与罗素在海牙碰面。罗素对书有了更深入的了解，即便并不完全赞同此书，比如“任何对世界整体的断言都是无意义的”，另外还有主论点“不能由命题说出的东西能被显示”。罗素答应为这本书写导言，W很欣喜，因为罗素名声在外。但是罗素写出来后，W并不对导言满意，甚至放弃了出版的想法。

后来W成为了一名教师。

## 一个纯农村的岗位

W以超常的要求教育农村孩子，加上他自身有很多怪癖，为村民所不解和抵制。最终导致了W的离开。

W的书最终在罗素的帮助下出版了。两人见面之后由于宗教原因不欢而散。W信奉基督，罗素是无神论者。

拉姆塞是最能理解W的书《逻辑哲学论》，并给出了解析。

W重新与凯恩斯、伊格尔曼等老友建立了联系。

## 走出荒野

W最终回到了奥地利他的家中。在姐姐格雷特的鼓励下，与玛格丽特谈恋爱，尽管这段关系令双方的朋友都不理解不支持。

石里克非常崇拜W，最终在格雷特的帮助下与W会面。石里克及其学生在多次会谈中意识到，W的《逻辑哲学论》虽然是哲学精确的范本，但W本人却充满了神秘主义。

拉姆塞想证明逻辑和数学命题是相等的，W则区分了两者。

凯恩斯对苏联的布尔什维克表示认可，认为是一种新宗教。罗素则持有贬义态度。

## 第二次到来

W回到了剑桥，经常与凯恩斯等人交谈。拉姆塞、斯拉法成了W最亲密的人。

## 证实主义阶段

玛格丽特不想与W保持超越友谊的关系。W为此决定开始写自传来剖析自己、战胜自己。

石里克和魏斯曼发现W的思想彻底地脱离了《逻辑哲学论》，这些新思想包含了康德式的口吻，令石里克和魏斯曼不安。但W另外一个思想则得到了广泛认可，"命题的意义是证实它的方法"。

W开始教授哲学课。其哲学观念是努力摆脱对语言的困惑。语法告诉我们什么有意义。为了证明其工作的成绩，W出版了《哲学评论》，总结了他与石里克和魏斯曼讨论的理论。这是一个过渡性的作品。

## 迷雾散去

W发现哲学是一种语法误用和误解的结果，所需的不是解答，而是消解。方法不在于构建新的理论，而在于收集已然知晓的线索。W认为我们永远达不到基本命题，只能到达使我们停止再提问的语言的边界。

W致力于把本质而非理论应用到数学哲学上去。他认为不需要逻辑人们就能自信地使用数学，类似不需要分析就能使用日常语言。或者说，人们不能靠等待一种理论来获得对数学的基本理解。

## 一个新的开始

W的笔记本中出现对魏宁格的引用和魏宁格式的反思。

W在犹太人本性上的许多言论，很容易被理解为法西斯反犹分子的咆哮。本质上，这些言论是内省的，代表了文化衰退和对新秩序的渴望。

W与玛格丽特的挪威行把他们结婚的念头掐灭了。

W本人把论数学的工作当作自己对哲学的最重要贡献。
