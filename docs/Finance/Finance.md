# Present Value Relations

### The Present Value Operator

An asset is a sequence of cashflows. 

$asset = \{CF_t, CF_{t+1}, ...\}$

$value\ of\ asset = V_t(CF_t, CF_{t+1}, ...)$

*What is V_t?*

One definition is market. 

Two distinct cases: w/ or w/o uncertainty (complete solution or approximation).
